# Fallout-terminal-unlocker

Tool to solve terminal puzzles in fallout

ToDo:

We gonna type the words ins the fallout terminal, count how many letters are in that words and how many of them are the same letter and in the same possition, we need to suggest a password and ask if it unlock the terminal.
If ir doesn't we need to ask for the likeness show in the terminal screen, and make the maths from.
How the maths are gonna be? I don't know yet, this first iteration of the readme is just for setting what I need to do and don't forget it later, and this is very first rough idea.
